# NER-Named-Entity-Recognition-app
Streamlit app for Named Entity Recognition (NER) using SpaCy, allowing users to extract and visualize entities (like names, places, dates, etc.) from text in real time.

This repository contains an interactive Named Entity Recognition (NER) web app built with Streamlit and SpaCy. The app enables users to paste any text (e.g., customer queries, documents, or sentences) and automatically extract key entities such as names, organizations, dates, locations, and more.

Along with text-based entity extraction, the app also provides a visual representation of entities using SpaCy’s displaCy visualizer, making it easier to understand how AI models process language.

✨ Features:

📝 User Input: Paste text or queries for real-time analysis

🔍 Entity Extraction: Identify entities like PERSON, ORG, DATE, GPE, etc.

🖼️ Entity Visualization: Highlight entities in text using SpaCy’s displaCy

⚡ Auto Model Handling: Automatically downloads en_core_web_sm if not available

🚀 Lightweight & Fast: Uses SpaCy’s small English model for quick processing

🛠 Tech Stack / Libraries Used:

Streamlit → For building the interactive UI

SpaCy → For Named Entity Recognition (NER)

displaCy → For entity highlighting and visualization

This project is perfect for:

Beginners learning NLP & NER

Developers exploring SpaCy + Streamlit integration

Businesses analyzing customer queries or text data

Students building NLP demo apps
